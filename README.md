Repo set for spiking on PACT with java 8, springboot and Junit5

Picked below from [PACT](https://docs.pact.io/)

    Contract testing is a technique for testing an integration point by checking each application in isolation to ensure the messages it sends or receives conform to a shared understanding that is documented in a "contract".

    Pact is a code-first tool for testing HTTP and message integrations using contract tests.


### Consumer :- order service

    Has following endpoints
        1. /getOrder -> fetches product information from productservice for product with id 1 & 2 (hardcoded) and returns order

Consumer contract tests are in ProductServiceContractTest.

To run tests run following command in productservice folder

    `$ mvn clean test`

This will generate pact contract files @ <project root>/orderservice/target/pacts/*.json

Run `$ mvn spring-boot:run` to start service


### Consumer :- web

    This is a simple React project which depends on product service. user can search for product by name in UI and matching products will be displayed

    Run `npm start` in web folder to start UI

    Run `npm run contracttests` to run contract tests. Pact contract files will be generated in <project root>/web/pacts/*.json


### Producer :- product service

    Has following endpoints
        1. /product/new -> used to setup data
        2. /product/search/name/{name} -> returns list of products with matching name
        3. /product/search/id/{id} -> returns product with id

ProductServiceApplication creates two products at boot time.

ContractTest class contains producer contract tests (auto generated by TestTemplate based on pact files). Copy the pact files generated by consumer contract tests (orderservice and web) into productservice/pacts folder manually. Pact broker is not yet implemented. @PactFolder on ContractTest maps the location of pact contract files.
To run tests run following command in productservice folder

    `$ mvn clean test`

Run `$ mvn spring-boot:run` to start service
